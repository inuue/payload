Views are the individual pages that make up the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), such as the Dashboard, [List View](./list-view), and [Edit View](./edit-view). One of the most powerful ways to customize the Admin Panel is to create Custom Views. These are [Custom Components](./overview) that can either replace built-in views or can be entirely new.

There are four types of views within the Admin Panel:

- [Root Views](#root-views)
- [Collection Views](#collection-views)
- [Global Views](#global-views)
- [Document Views](./document-views)

To swap in your own Custom View, first determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, consult the list of available components, then [author your React component(s)](#building-custom-views) accordingly.

## Config

### Replacing Views

To customize views, use the `admin.components.views` property in your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview). This is an object with keys for each view you want to customize. Each key corresponds to the view you want to customize.

The exact list of available keys depends on the scope of the view you are customizing, depending on whether it's a [Root View](#root-views), [Collection View](#collection-views), or [Global View](#global-views). Regardless of the scope, the principles are the same.

Here is an example of how to swap out the built-in Dashboard view:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        // highlight-start
        dashboard: {
          Component: '/path/to/MyCustomDashboard',
        }
        // highlight-end
      }
    }
  }
})
```

For more granular control, pass a configuration object instead. Payload exposes the following properties for each view:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Component` * | Pass in the component path that should be rendered when a user navigates to this route.                                                                                                         |
| `path` *      | Any valid URL path or array of paths that [`path-to-regexp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regex) understands.                                                                     |
| `exact`        | Boolean. When true, will only match if the path matches the `usePathname()` exactly.                                                                                                     |
| `strict`       | When true, a path that has a trailing slash will only match a `location.pathname` with a trailing slash. This has no effect when there are additional URL segments in the pathname. |
| `sensitive`    | When true, will match if the path is case sensitive.|
| `meta`         | Page metadata overrides to apply to this view within the Admin Panel. [More details](./metadata).                                                                           |

_* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

### Adding New Views

To add a _new_ views to the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview), simply add your own key to the `views` object. New views require at least the `Component` and `path` properties.

Here is an example of how to add a new Root View:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        // highlight-start
        myCustomView: {
        // highlight-end
          Component: '/path/to/MyCustomView#MyCustomViewComponent',
          path: '/my-custom-view',
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<Banner type="warning">
  **Note:**
  Routes are cascading, so unless explicitly given the `exact` property, they will
  match on URLs that simply _start_ with the route's path. This is helpful when creating catch-all
  routes in your application. Alternatively, define your nested route _before_ your parent
  route.

<Banner type="warning">
  **Custom views are public**
  Custom views are public by default. If your view requires a user to be logged in or to have certain access rights, you should handle that within your view component yourself.
</Banner>

### View Templates

Your Custom Root Views can optionally use one of the templates that Payload provides. The most common of these is the Default Template which provides the basic layout and navigation.

Here is an example of how to use the Default Template in your Custom View:

```tsx
import type { AdminViewProps } from 'payload'

import { DefaultTemplate } from '@payloadcms/next/templates'
import { Gutter } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import React from 'react'

export function MyCustomView({
  initPageResult,
  params,
  searchParams,
}: AdminViewProps) {
  return (
    <DefaultTemplate
      i18n={initPageResult.req.i18n}
      locale={initPageResult.locale}
      params={params}
      payload={initPageResult.req.payload}
      permissions={initPageResult.permissions}
      searchParams={searchParams}
      user={initPageResult.req.user || undefined}
      visibleEntities={initPageResult.visibleEntities}
    >
      <Gutter>
        <h1>Custom Default Root View</h1>
        <p>This view uses the Default Template.</p>
      </Gutter>
    </DefaultTemplate>
  )
}
```

_For details on how to build Custom Views, including all available props, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._

## Root Views

Root Views are the main views of the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). These are views that are scoped directly under the `/admin` route, such as the Dashboard or Account views.

To swap out Root Views with your own, or to [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-views), use the `admin.components.views` property at the root of your[Payload Config](../configuration/overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

const config = buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        // highlight-start
        dashboard: {
          Component: '/path/to/Dashboard',
        }
        // highlight-end
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The following options are available:

| Property        | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account`   | The Account view is used to show the currently logged in user's Account page. |
| `dashboard` | The main landing page of the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview).                                     |

<Banner type="success">
  **Note:**
  You can also add _new_ Root Views to the config by adding a new key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. See [Adding New Views](#adding-new-views) for more information.

## Collection Views

Collection Views are views that are scoped under the `/collections` route, such as the Collection List and Document Edit views.

To swap out Collection Views with your own, or to [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-views), use the `admin.components.views` property of your [Collection Config](../configuration/collections):

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollectionConfig: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        // highlight-start
        list: {
          Component: '/path/to/MyCustomListView',
        }
        // highlight-end
      },
    },
  },
}
```

_For details on how to build Custom Views, including all available props, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._

The following options are available:

| Property   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edit` | The Edit View corresponds to a single Document for any given Collection. It is comprised of many different sub-views. [More details](./document-views).            |
| `list` | The List View is used to show a list of Documents for any given Collection. [More details](#list-view).                                                            |

<Banner type="success">
  **Note:**
  You can also add _new_ Collection Views to the config by adding a new key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. See [Adding New Views](#adding-new-views) for more information.

## Global Views

Global Views are views that are scoped under the `/globals` route, such as the Edit View.

To swap out Global Views with your own or [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-views), use the `admin.components.views` property in your [Global Config](../configuration/globals):

```ts
import type { SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyGlobalConfig: SanitizedGlobalConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        myGlobalView: {
          // highlight-start
          Component: '/path/to/MyCustomGlobalView',
          path: '/my-custom-global-view',
          // highlight-end
        }
      },
    },
  },
}
```

_For details on how to build Custom Views, including all available props, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._

The following options are available:

| Property   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edit` | The Edit View corresponds to a single Document for any given Global. It is comprised of many different sub-views. [More details](./document-views). |

<Banner type="success">
  **Note:**
  You can also add _new_ Global Views to the config by adding a new key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. See [Adding New Views](#adding-new-views) for more information.

## Building Custom Views

Custom Views are simply [Custom Components](./overview) rendered at the page-level. To understand how to build Custom Views, first review the [Building Custom Components](./overview#building-custom-components) guide. Once you have a Custom Component ready, you can use it as a Custom View.

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollectionConfig: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        edit: {
          Component: '/path/to/MyCustomView' // highlight-line
        }
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Default Props

Your Custom Views will be provided with the following props:

| Prop                      | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initPageResult`      | An object containing `req`, `payload`, `permissions`, etc.                                                                         |
| `clientConfig`        | The Client Config object. [More details](./overview#accessing-the-payload-config).                                        |
| `importMap`           | The import map object.                                                                                                             |
| `params`              | An object containing the [Dynamic Route Parameters](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes). |
| `searchParams`        | An object containing the [Search Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters).  |
| `doc`                 | The document being edited. Only available in Document Views. [More details](./document-views).                                      |

<Banner type="success">
  **Reminder:**
  All [Custom Server Components](./overview) receive `payload` and `i18n` by default. See [Building Custom Components](./overview#building-custom-components) for more details.
</Banner>

Here is an example of a Custom View component:

```tsx
import type { AdminViewProps } from 'payload'

import { Gutter } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import React from 'react'

export function MyCustomView(props: AdminViewProps) {
  return (
    <Gutter>
      <h1>Custom Default Root View</h1>
      <p>This view uses the Default Template.</p>
    </Gutter>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  **Tip:**
  For consistent layout and navigation, you may want to wrap your Custom View with one of the built-in [Template](./overview#templates).
</Banner>

### Security

All Custom Views are public by default. It's up to you to secure your custom views. If your view requires a user to be logged in or to have certain access rights, you should handle that within your view component yourself.

Here is how you might secure a Custom View:

```tsx
import type { AdminViewProps } from 'payload'

import { Gutter } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import React from 'react'

export function MyCustomView({
  initPageResult
}: AdminViewProps) {
  const {
    req: {
      user
    }
  } = initPageResult

  if (!user) {
    return <p>You must be logged in to view this page.</p>
  }

  return (
    <Gutter>
      <h1>Custom Default Root View</h1>
      <p>This view uses the Default Template.</p>
    </Gutter>
  )
}
```
