The List View is where users interact with a list of Documents within a [Collection](../collections/overview). This is where they can view, sort, filter, and paginate their documents to find exactly what they're looking for. This is also where users can perform bulk operations on multiple documents at once, such as deleting, editing, or publishing them.

The List View can be injected with a number of [Custom Components](./overview) to add additional functionality or presentational elements, or it can be swapped out in its entirety for a [Custom View](./custom-views).

## Custom List View

```tsx

```

## Custom Components

To override List View components for a Collection, use the `admin.components` property in your [Collection Config](../configuration/collections):

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    components: {
      // ...
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `beforeList`         | A button that saves the current document.                                                                                                                                  |
| `beforeListTable`    | A button that saves the current document as a draft.                                                                                                                                  |
| `afterList`      | A button that publishes the current document.                                                                                                                                  |
| `afterListTable`      | A button that previews the current document.                                                                                                                                  |
| `Description`             | A file upload component.                                                                                                                                  |

## beforeList

The `beforeList` property allows you to inject custom components before the list of documents in the List View. This is useful for adding additional information or functionality to the List View without replacing the entire view.

To add `beforeList` components, use the `components.beforeList` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      beforeList: [
        // Add your custom components here
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

## beforeListTable

## afterList

## afterListTable
