Document Views are views that are scoped under the `/collections/:collectionSlug/:id` or the `/globals/:globalSlug` route, such as the Edit View or the API View. All Document Views keep their overall structure across navigation changes, such as their title and tabs, and replace only the content below.

To swap out Document Views with your own, or to [create entirely new ones](#adding-new-views), use the `admin.components.views.edit[key]` property in your [Collection Config](../configuration/collections) or [Global Config](../configuration/globals):

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollectionOrGlobalConfig: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        edit: {
          api: {
            Component: '/path/to/MyCustomAPIViewComponent', // highlight-line
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

_For details on how to build Custom Views, including all available props, see [Building Custom Views](#building-custom-views)._

 **Note:**
 If you need to replace the _entire_ Edit View, including _all_ nested Document Views, use the `root` key. See [Custom Collection Views](#collection-views) or [Custom Global Views](#global-views) for more information.

The following options are available:

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`        | The Root View overrides all other nested views and routes. No document controls or tabs are rendered when this key is set.                                      |
| `default`     | The Default View is the primary view in which your document is edited. It is rendered within the "Edit" tab. [More details](./edit-view).                                                    |
| `versions`    | The Versions View is used to navigate the version history of a single document. It is rendered within the "Versions" tab. [More details](../versions/overview). |
| `version`     | The Version View is used to edit a single version of a document. It is rendered within the "Version" tab. [More details](../versions/overview).                 |
| `api`         | The API View is used to display the REST API JSON response for a given document. It is rendered within the "API" tab.                                           |
| `livePreview` | The LivePreview view is used to display the Live Preview interface. It is rendered within the "Live Preview" tab. [More details](../live-preview/overview).     |

### Document Tabs

Each Custom View can be given a new tab in the Edit View, if desired. Tabs are highly configurable, from as simple as changing the label to swapping out the entire component, they can be modified in any way. To add or customize tabs in the Edit View, use the `tab` key:

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyCollection: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        edit: {
          myCustomTab: {
            Component: '/path/to/MyCustomTab',
            path: '/my-custom-tab',
            tab: {
              Component: '/path/to/MyCustomTabComponent' // highlight-line
            }
          },
          anotherCustomTab: {
            Component: '/path/to/AnotherCustomView',
            path: '/another-custom-view',
            // highlight-start
            tab: {
              label: 'Another Custom View',
              href: '/another-custom-view',
            }
            // highlight-end
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```
